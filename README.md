# Sentiment Analysis of Hotel Reviews using RNN
Different variants of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), namely Vanilla RNN, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a combination of these with multiplicative attention are implemented in PyTorch for Sentiment Analysis of over 515,000 reviews of around 1,400 hotels in Europe (source: https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe). 100-dimensional GloVe representations of the words are also used for the embedding of the vocabulary. To handle reviews of different lengths, the input to the models are padded using pack_padded_sequence. Using the train.py file one can choose to use this representations or even choose to keep these representations as trainable parameters. The data is preprocessed and a sample of 100,000 reviews is taken. The models achieve an accuracy of 91%, 92%, 93% and 95% respectively.
