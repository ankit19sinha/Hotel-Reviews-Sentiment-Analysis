# Sentiment Analysis of Hotel Reviews using RNN
Different variants of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), namely Vanilla RNN, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a combination of these with multiplicative and additive attention are implemented in PyTorch for Sentiment Analysis of over 515,000 reviews of around 1,400 hotels in Europe (source: https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe). 100-dimensional GloVe representations of the words are also used for the embedding of the vocabulary. Effect of different types of padding like pack padded sequence, padded sequence and no padding is observed. Using the train.py file one can choose to use this representations or even choose to keep these representations as trainable parameters. The models with attention work best with an accuracy of 94% for additive attention and 96% for multiplicative attention.
